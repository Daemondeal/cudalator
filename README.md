## How to build

```sh
git submodule update --init --depth 1 --recursive
pip install orderedmultidict

make
```

You can run `make run` to run the code on an example circuit

## Folder Structure

- `rtl_examples`: some example circuits to compile.
- `runtime`: the template for the runtime generated by Cudalator:
    - `codegen-example`: handwritten part that would be codegen in a real run, just for testing purposes.
    - `runtime-lib`: library of classes used by the codegen.
    - `src`: the actual runtime that handles kernel scheduling.
- `src`: the sources for the compiler itself.
- `third_party`: the submodules for external packages.

## Docs

Docs are available at [https://daemondeal.github.io/cudalator/](https://daemondeal.github.io/cudalator/). You can also read them locally by running run `mkdocs serve`.


If you are a contributor, run `mkdocs gh-deploy` whenever you modify the docs.

## Dependencies

- CMake (version 3.21 or more)
- Ninja
- CUDA
- Probably more hopefully at some point we will discover this
